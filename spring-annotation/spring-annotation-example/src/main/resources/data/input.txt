The resource paths in application context constructor values may be a simple 
path (as shown above) which has a one-to-one mapping to a target Resource, 
or alternately may contain the special "classpath*:" prefix and/or internal 
Ant-style regular expressions (matched using Spring’s PathMatcher utility). 
Both of the latter are effectively wildcards

One use for this mechanism is when doing component-style application assembly. 
All components can 'publish' context definition fragments to a well-known 
location path, and when the final application context is created using the 
same path prefixed via classpath*:, all component fragments will be picked up 
automatically.

Note that this wildcarding is specific to use of resource paths in application 
context constructors (or when using the PathMatcher utility class hierarchy 
directly), and is resolved at construction time. It has nothing to do with 
the Resource type itself. It’s not possible to use the classpath*: prefix to 
construct an actual Resource, as a resource points to just one resource at a time.
